          <h3>Crop Disease Prediction</h3>
          <p>The Crop Disease Prediction System is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers and agricultural
            experts detect crop diseases early. Using deep learning and computer vision, it analyses leaf images to
            identify diseases across crops like cashew, cassava, guava, maize, pumpkin, and tomato. Built with Flask, it
            offers a user-friendly interface for image uploads, instant predictions, and treatment recommendations. The
            system uses a CNN model for accurate classification, along with user authentication, secure image handling,
            and prediction history storage. It aims to promote precision farming, reduce crop losses, and support
            sustainable agriculture.</p>
